            <h2 className="tips">Watch What You Flush</h2>
            <h4 className="tips-info">If you start flushing things other than toilet paper and bodily waste down the toilet, you could cause some serious clogs that we’re betting you really don’t want to deal with. That includes hygiene products, cotton balls, prescription medications, and yes…unfortunate fish.</h4>
            <h2 className="tips">4. Know Where Your Main Water Valve Is</h2>
            <h4 className="tips-info">If, knock on wood, you have pipes burst, turning off your main water valve will help minimize the damage until we can get there to help. If you don’t know where it is, you’re going to spend a lot of time scrambling while your home sustains significant water damage.</h4>
            <h2 className="tips">5. Test Your Toilet’s Flush Valve Seal For Leaks</h2>
            <h4 className="tips-info">One of the places you’ll likely find a leak is in your toilet’s flush valve seal. The flush valve seal is what keeps water from flowing from the tank to the bowl of your toilet when it isn’t in flushing mode. Catching a leak in your flush valve seal early requires a simple test: food colouring.No, you didn’t misread that. All it takes is a couple of drops of food colouring in your toilet tank. Check back in a few hours. If some of the coloured water has found its way into your toilet bowl, that means you have a leak.</h4>
            <h2 className="tips">6. Prevent Your Plumbing From Freezing</h2>
            <h4 className="tips-info">One of the best plumbing tips we can give you is to make sure that your always have air circulating through your home, and that is at a minimum temperature of 16 degrees Celsius.
